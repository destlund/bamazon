*The most sophisticated eCommerce app I've ever made.*

## The user interface:

Start the app by typing `node bamazon-customer.js`:

You will be charged appropriately and the items will ship post-haste from our state-of-the-art warehouse.

You can continue shopping:

Try not to order a product that isn't one of our ten fabulous products:

Since we are a very real business with real inventory limitations, please do not order more than we have in stock:

When finished shopping, simply exit Bamazon by refusing to continue shopping. We thank you for your business!
